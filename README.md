Sometimes even the things we see with our naked eyes is not the “naked” truth. It needs time,conviction and certainty to get behind the truth. EDA — Exploratory Data Analysis - does this for Machine Learning enthusiast. It is a way of visualizing, summarizing and interpreting the information that is hidden in rows and column format. EDA is one of the crucial step in data science that allows us to achieve certain insights and statistical measure that is essential for the business continuity, stockholders and data scientists. It performs to define and refine our important features variable selection, that will be used in our model.  Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its feature can be used for supervised and unsupervised machine learning modelling. The EDA is executed majorly by Uni-variate visualization, Bi-variate visualization, Multivariate Visualization and Dimensionality reduction.  We initially make several hypothesis by looking at the data before we hit the modelling. And its quite a good practice cause that will engage you more with EDA part. EDA helps you in confirming and validating the hypothesis you make. And from here you start your feature engineering part and take a flight to machine learning modelling.  Here, we will explore the power of EDA using a dataset.
